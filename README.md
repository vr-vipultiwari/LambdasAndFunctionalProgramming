## Lamdbas are nothing but anynomus function in java.

1. We can pass lambda where ever where single abstract method interfaces object is expected such as runnable.
2. It is not a good practice to write logic in lambda. Instead put logic into a function and call that fuction within the lambda.
3. We can use method reference when we just want to pass the incomming parameter without do any modification to another method. The other method can be an instance    method or it can be a static method.
